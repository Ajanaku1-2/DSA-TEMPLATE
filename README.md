Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy, is the driving force behind the continent’s fintech revolution. The country accounts for 28% of all African fintech companies and is a leading hub for venture capital (VC) funding, capturing the highest share of fintech funding in African fintech companies between 2020 and H1 2024 at roughly 36%.

## This rapidly growing ecosystem, which now comprises more than 430 fintech companies, also hosts some of the continent’s most prominent and influential players in the industry.

Today, we take a look at Nigeria’s top fintechs, showcasing the country’s most impactful fintech companies, highlighting their value propositions, and delving into their recent milestones.

1. For this list, we focus on private, independent fintech companies based in Nigeria, excluding the likes of Flutterwave, which is headquartered in the US, and Kuda Bank, based in London. We also exclude those that have been acquired or which are affiliated with major banks, telecom providers, or established entities, such as Paystack (acquired by PayPal in 2020), and MoMo Payment Service, a subsidiary of MTN Nigeria Communications. This approach aims to provide a clear view of Nigeria’s homegrown fintech trailblazers.
